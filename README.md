# Hi! I'm Adelto.
If you need to know something about me, it's that I'm real stupid. I can barely code a discord bot without asking for help from my friends. Then again, I have some real smart friends. (im looking a u [minsiam](https://github.com/minsiam)) Not all of my friends are smart, but most are. So, I'm good at a SMALL amount of things, and when I say "SMALL" I mean it. I'm good at HTML? maybe- or CSS? maybe not- but JS, fuck no. I'm trash at JS. I like to experiment, which at the time im writing this, I'm experimenting with [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer). Thats all, probably. If you need to contact me, go to Discord and send a friend request to **adelto**. I'll accept. Probably. If you tell me who you are. So, I hope to meet you around!
